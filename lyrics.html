and nows the chance to tell me everything before i end up dead


just wanna know if youre


alright
the way you looked at me 
i might be overthinking, its unhealthy
i bet you think about me 
all night
everything inside tells me youre the one i like
wish you could see 
the way i see you in my
own eyes
are you alright? are you alright?
baby are you alright? 


and i dont think ill make it out alive
but even if you asked, i wont oblige
im sorry i dont have what youre looking for
im sorry i dont have what youre looking for
turned against me with all your friends
i might just say it twice, ill say it again
and now i see you in his shirt (are you srs?)

    <div class="desc">wrote you letters in october but you read it in may
tried to tap you on your shoulder but you pushed me away
wanna run to your place, but im a little too late
i dont know what you want me to say


we fell inlove at 14
but i dont think that youre the 1 4 me
we fell so deep at 14
but i dont think that youre the 1 4 me
not the 1 4 me
14 
but i dont think that youre the 1 4 me
we fell so deep at 14
but i dont think that youre the 1 4 me
not the 1 4 me


you said it was nothing, but im not blind
i saw the way you looked at him when he walked by
but when i did the same, somehow im the bad guy?
i wanna mess wit ur head like u did wit mine
and then you swear you felt it coming
still you kept on running
stared at him too long and
said your heart meant nothing
claimed that you were changing
but you were just bluffing
mad i found somebody
guess that makes us nothing


gave you my heart at 14
but i dont think that youre the 1 4 me
we fell so deep at 14
but i dont think that youre the 1 4 me
not the 1 4 me
14 
but i dont think that youre the 1 4 me
you were way different at 14
but i dont think that youre the 1 4 me
not the 1 4 me


we fell inlove at 14
but i dont think that youre the 1 4 me
we fell so deep at 14
but i dont think that youre the 1 4 me
not the 1 4 me
14 
but i dont think that youre the 1 4 me
we fell so deep at 14
but i dont think that youre the 1 4 me
gave you my heart at 14

its a quarter past ten, can we meet again?
got things i wanna say but i dont think youd hear the end
like where were you when i needed you, it just dont make no sense
but who am i to act on it, im no longer in your head


cuz what are you looking for?
i thought i was all you wanted
now you dont know who you are
cuz what are you looking for?
i thought i was all you wanted
now im the one you ignore


i know im still on your mind (mind)
when you see the stars at night (night)
and you know that you cant hide (hide)
i just hope we coincide (coincide)


2 years ago when you were looking at me
you whispered "i love you" when we were in the backseat
remember those promises where you said youre mine?
now youre with him like what the fuck was the point?


if you saw it, in my eyes
i was dying when you werent there
i wasnt ready for goodbyes
but i dont think you seemed to care
did you think i forgot what you said?
cant believe i cried over you
now you just left me in dread
would you believe i wouldve died for you</div>

    <div class="desc">part I
      
here we go again, you never try to speak 
then ill end up chasing you right down the street
leading on myself, dont know what to believe
all the doubt i dealt before my soul depletes
but do you know just how it feels?
to be ignored like im not there
when everyone just turned their backs on you
and so i bottled up my tears


looked my way but i dont think she wants to
talk to me, and i dont think she even
thought of me, but id feel better
if you talk to me, could you talk to me?
bones now left to rust, consuming every part
right from my lungs, and im slowly losing
all my fuckin trust, cuz everything i did
was all for what? was all for what?


why cant yall show me that yall ever care?
like when i just try to talk, its like yall are never there
and i dont even really wanna compare
but the shit i do for yall, its like yall are never fair
like what the fuck? i noticed
that every word feels hopeless
am i a burden cuz it
hurts that we just turned to strangers
but yall—


looked my way but i dont think they want to
talk to me, and i dont even think they
thought of me, but id feel better
if yall talk to me, could yall talk to me?
bones now left to rust, consuming every part
right from my lungs, and im slowly losing
all my fuckin trust, cuz everything i did
was all for what? was all for waahahaha fuck


      part II


and then youre pulling me apart in pieces
while im at my worst then you gave your reasons
our spot is where you left me bleeding
and you shushed my mouth when you were speaking
like good for you, you found your worth
but why did you just make it worse?
left me bleeding by the trees and
you apologized but do you really mean it?


dnd, on a dinner with death
and i told him all about your regrets
im not the one you deserve i bet
just sucks cuz youre the one i wanted
and now youre pulling me apart
you tore my limbs and took my heart
and now im seeing who you are
and now im seeing who you are


and then youre pulling me apart in pieces
while im at my worst then you gave your reasons
our spot is where you left me bleeding
and you shushed my mouth when you were speaking

i tried to stay no matter how it hurt
i watched the clock as every second burned
and then u broke me and left me on the curb
i waited out until theres nothing left
i waited out til my heart dont beat my chest
you said some things you never really meant
you told me sht that pierced right through my flesh


was on my chair, you texted me "lets reconnect"
i thought you hated me, thats why you fcking left
you let me in again, it just dont make no sense
you said you were scared of what our friends would think
now youre thinking whats next?
when you thought its for the best
and now who would you text,
when youre crying in bed?
and we've been here before
watched you walk out the door
and i slept on the floor
cant believe you wanted more

do you know what its like to dream abt this every single night?
or do you know what its like to hope a different outcome every flight
now youre thinking whats next?

cuz theyre perfect, im hurting, cant clear up my mind
theyre all one step ahead while im wasting my time
writing these poems, for people that cry
but i think its okay cuz ill just leave at night


and i envy all my friends
who seem so perfect til theyre dead
who seems the type that can impress
with calm patience and lessened stress
and i envy all my friends
who seem so perfect til theyre dead
theres jus no screaming in their heads
theres jus no screaming in their heads


leave me dead if you hate me, i know im aware
cant blend in, am i annoying? ill get off your hair
sorry if i talk too much i know that you dont rly care
i know that im different from my friends but please do not compare


keep getting tongue-tied, hard to speak how i feel
more than just one time, my emotions concealed
his only son died, 50/50 ill make it real
more than just one time, my emotions concealed
cuz theyre perfect, im hurting, cant clear up my mind
theyre all one step ahead while im wasting my time
i cant keep up, u can see it in my eyes

while you got that bad energy i cant be around
and then u stabbed me in the back while we were skipping towns
while you paint yourself with lies you found
i know for a fact youll never change
i know for a fact youll never change
i know for a fact youll never change
i know for a fact youll never change

blood on my white tee
from the words you've said to me
hate what i have
so i bathe in blood, it stained my teeth
i just wanna dance in my room
and i'll eat my eyes in the afternoon
missing you bad now i smell your perfume


ive been up and i saw the sun rise
and i know its my fault and i know i lied
but i hate your friends, i apologize
but i dont wanna waste my time on crying
so i changed your contact, i changed my phone
you live nearby so i moved from home
but the lights are on, you can knock on the door
but this time i dont know you anymore


i dont know you anymore
i dont know you anymore
i dont know you anymore
i dont know you anymore
cuz i dont know you anymore
i dont know you anymore
i dont know you anymore
lights are open, you can knock on the door


reading all the letters that you wrote me and i cried
then i somehow ended js up on the floor, slept on my side
missing when you talk to me, can we please meet tonight?
and im losing all my grip, i lost my mind, i cant decide
all of it was from my heart, what i gave you
i fucked up and i know my mistakes too
honestly i dont really blame you
but its hard to move on when i dont hate you


i dont know you i dont know you i dont know you i dont know you

i hear you
plotting, walking, i can see you nodding
saw that look you gave me when you saw i started talking
would you be happy if i tore off my skin?
putting me down so you can see yourself just win
watch it, stop it, this is what youre causing
driven by your ego ever sinced you fucking walked in
would you be happy if i burn inside
as my soul just lingers through your mind


and youre talking more, i hate feeling compared
and youre so naive, and unaware

maybe soon enough youll understand why they left
and the older you get, you'll feel a bit of resent
and the friends that you'll get will either leave you impressed
or prolly soon play with strings that belong in your head
and sure you did it badly but i'll do it worse
and it keeps on repeating and the cycle just hurts
i lowkey think i lost both our favorite shirt
i just wish that i could warn you about the shit i went through first
and its something you shouldnt have to go through
you deserve the world more than i do


i hope you know all the words that i meant
cuz im standing here and ill keep it direct
and ill work hard for things that you only have dreamt
and i hope youre prepared for the things i have felt
i wish that i could be you again
ill do it for you

you looked at me so differently
could you rewrite the things ive said?
or the things that went?
or the things i did?


ohhhhh, i fed the fire with my mistakes
watched it burn whats left of me
i told you to get away from me
ohhhhh, i shouldve never had a name
i messed the line you meant to say in your story
you shouldve ripped the page


and maybe then if i tried harder
maybe id be something more
you were outside with your brother
and i was passed out on the floor
talked down then you went your way
you said some things that you didnt think
and i still remember your taste
no matter how much i try to drink

they helped me to learn to crawl but i just wasted their time
deserve the consequences of my actions that i made
and ill play it cool but ill break my bones to make you feel okay
wish that i was better at meaning the words i throw when i feel scared
kept my tears inside a bottle, i dont think that you care


i didnt push yall away, js didnt believe in ur help
i wasnt mad at you, i was just mad at myself
every open hand just reminded me of guilt
so i bled on their arms just to prove how i felt
im doing better than my past year self 
but im pretty sure he was happier
and everything i wrote, its on the wall
and everything i wrote, its on the wall

even though i was really stubborn
ive always loved u like a mother
oh oh
oh, father
you gave me love just like no other
youre always there so i feel covered
your boy is growing, filled with wonder
i got the whole world to discover


where could i go when its late outside
while im out on my own and i hate my cries
i felt like id break if i stayed in my mind
so i learned from my past and i left it all behind


where would i be without the dude thats from the start 
we dont talk much now but we'll never drift apart
where would i be without the guy with the cameras
you helped with my mental and you saw the damages
and to the kid with the black guitar 
i see myself within you and i know youll make it far 
my brother from another mother's from the west 
i hold you close so dearly in my heart thats in my chest 
and to my dawg, ong we tuff 
oh how have u not had enough 
and to the girl i failed to love 
im sorry i wasnt the one
and to the dude with the urge to fight 
we screaming up in vc arguments every night
and to the dude who helped to start it all 
i love you like a brother, hope you never feel as small 
      

this for the girl who felt it first
sorry for who i was and how i made it worse
u put up w my shit and it made u hurt
u deserved to drag me thru the dirt
and to the dude i was once close with
we were both wrong and yea u know it
i guess ill start with the approaching
and im so sorry for my actions
