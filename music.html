alright   after   all   of   that   happened.   this   song   is   also   a   direct   sequel   to   "r   u   ok"   wherein   i   genuinely   wanna   know   if   
shes   doing   alright   since   i   never   got   the   chance   to   ask...   'r   u   ok'   was   the   question   in   my   mind    for   the   longest   time

in   a   spotify   editorial   playlist   lol.   anyways,   this   song   is   about   that   feeling   when   you   fall   inlove   at   a   young   age   but   suddenly   it    just   disappears   as   time   moves   on.   i   had   the   'one   four'   idea   for   so   long   and   im   glad   i   was   able   to   execute   it   just   fine   in   this   album.</div>

    </div>
    <div class="desc">the   album   name   and   the   first   two   part   song   i   have   ever   done.   this   song   took   me   three   months   to   make   cuz   i   did   not   know   
how   to   perfectly   execute   this.   i   really   love   the   meaning   and   the   metaphor   behind   this   song;   the   first   half   goes   on   
about   why   do   i   feel   so   shit   and   invisible   to   people   like   why   do   i   never   feel   noticed   anymore   and   as   the   tension   
builds   up,   we   get   to   the   second   song   where   it   explains   everything   (why   im   being   ignored   nd   shit).   the   second   song   
explains   that   my   past   lover   has   killed   me   and   i   was   just   an   entity   the   entire   time   like   a   ghost.   the   metaphor   behind   
it   is   literally   the   song   title   itself,   you   found   what   you   love   and   it   got   you   killed.   a   love   and   a   heartbreak   song   
into   one   ;)

actually   just   insane   but   overall,   this   song   was   written   about   when   ive   been   holding   on   to   the   hope   that   she   would   
return   lol   yeah.   i   kept   the   hope   that   maaaaaaybe   yooooouuuuuuuuuuuud   retuuuuuurnnnnnnnnnnn!i!i!ii!i!i!i!i!i!i!i!!ii!i!

discovered   me   from   that   vid).   this   song   is   about   that   previous-previous   ex   girlfriend   of   mine   wherein   there   are   2   
different   versions   of   her:   when   we   started   dating   and   when   she   left.   "i   dont   know   you   anymore"   is   a   line   i   kept   
repeating   in   my   head   the   day   we   broke   up   (i   never   directly   said   it   to   her)   cuz   the   girl   whom   i   loved   was   not   the   
same   girl   who   left   me   if   yall   get   what   im   trying   to   put   here.   it   sucks   cuz   i   met   her   when   we   were   really   young   
(around   7-8)   and   we   grew   up   together   too.   we   started   dating   in   high   school   then   yeah   she   left   but   its   okay   cuz   i

that   she   just   never   dated   me   instead,   like   how   easy   it   is   to   rip   a   page   off   a   book.   the   entire   page   is   filled   of

found   an   old   note   i   had   written   that   i   never   got   to   finish   cuz   my   friends   (who   i   am   thankful   for)   asked   me   to   
play   roblox   lol.   even   the   simplest   thing   can   do   so   much   for   a   person   and   no   one   realizes   it   til   its   too   late   
so   im   thankful   for   my   friends   cuz   everything   yall   are   reading,   viewing,   listening   to   right   now   would   not   exist   if   it   werent   for   them.   love   yall   bruh.</div>

life   goes   on   and   how   i   want   to   share   it   with   you   all.   i   think   its   a   beautiful   thing   idk.   yall   have   seen   me   
grow   as   a   person   and   i   love   yall   for   staying   with   me.   two-thousand seven   in   the   title   doesnt   really   mean   anything   since   its   
the   year   i   was   born   lol.   but   i   just   thought   that   maybe   this   meaning   of   a   song   would   be   a   good   outro.   idk   im   
buggin.   this   whole   album   i   sang   about   heartbreak   and   loss   and   envy   but   here,   i   sing   about   two   people   who   have   kept   me   alive   for   years   and   i   hold   so   dearly   in   my   
heart;   my   grandma   and   my   dad.   i   cried   to   this   the   moment   i   heard   it   after   making   this   and   lowkey,   a   simple   
thank   you   isnt   enough   for   everything   they   provided   for   me   hahaha.</div>
