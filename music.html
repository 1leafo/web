alright   after   all   of   that   happened.   this   song   is   also   a   direct   sequel   to   "r   u   ok"   wherein   i   genuinely   wanna   know   if   
shes   doing   alright   since   i   never   got   the   chance   to   ask...   'r   u   ok'   was   the   question   in   my   mind    for   the   longest   time   
but   the   question   i   was   able   to   bring   out   was   'r   u   alright'......   pretty   much   mean   the   same   thing   but   on   a   deeper   level,   you'll   get   it :)</div>

in   a   spotify   editorial   playlist   lol.   anyways,   this   song   is   about   that   feeling   when   you   fall   inlove   at   a   young   age   but   suddenly   it    just   disappears   as   time   moves   on.   i   had   the   'one   four'   idea   for   so   long   and   im   glad   i   was   able   to   execute   it   just   fine   in   this   album.</div>

    <div class="desc">idk   this   song   basically   has   that   delusional   feeling   when   you   think   that   they   still   think   about   you.   i   wrote   this   a
  looooong   time ago   so   i   just   thought   it   was   a   perfect   addition   to   the   album   lol.   i   used   to   have   this   feeling   wherein  
im   still   stuck   in   the   past   and   everything   is   filled   with   memories   of   what   she   and   i   used   to   have.   ive   finally   moved  
on   from   it   and   left   it   all   in   the   past   after   recording   this   song   last   december   and   repolishing   it   with   a   new  
instrumental   months   after.   hell   yeaaah.</div>

    <div class="desc">the   album   name   and   the   first   two   part   song   i   have   ever   done.   this   song   took   me   three   months   to   make   cuz   i   did   not   know   
how   to   perfectly   execute   this.   i   really   love   the   meaning   and   the   metaphor   behind   this   song   as   the   entire   song   is   a   
metaphor   for   heartbreak.   the   first   half   goes   on   about   why   do   i   feel   so   shit   and   invisible   and   unheard   to   the   people  
i   love   like   why   do   i   never   feel   noticed   anymore   and   as   the   tension   builds   up,   we   get   to   the   second   half   where   it   
explains   everything   (why   im   being   ignored   nd   shit).   the   high   energy   second   half   of   the   song   is   basically   death.  
  she   killed   you.   a   metaphor   of   what   she   did   emotionally   after   yall   broke   up.   tried   my   best   to   not   sound   edgy   with 
  the   explanation   but   i   wanted   yall   to see   it   with   in   my   vision   so   idk.    ;)

actually   just   insane   but   overall,   this   song   was   written   about   when   ive   been   holding   on   to   the   hope   that   she   would

buggin.   this   whole   album   i   sang   about   heartbreak   and   loss   and   envy   but   here,   i   sing   about   thanking   and   apologizing   to   people   who   have   kept   me   alive   for   years   as   i   also   sing   about   2   people   who   i   hold   so   dearly   in   my   
heart;   my   grandma   and   my   dad.   i   cried   to   this   the   moment   i   heard   it   after   making   this   and   lowkey,   a   simple   
thank   you   isnt   enough   for   everything   they   provided   for   me   hahaha.   check   out   the   video   <a href="https://youtu.be/syMo5t1VSD0" target="_blank">here</a> </div>
